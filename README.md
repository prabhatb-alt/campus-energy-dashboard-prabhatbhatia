# Campus Energy-Use Dashboard

A simple, beginner-friendly Python project that ingests building meter CSVs, cleans and enriches the data, computes daily / weekly / building-level aggregates, and produces a compact dashboard + executive summary for a campus. Designed to be clear, viva-safe, and easy to run.

## Features
- Reads multiple building CSV files from `data/` (auto-detects `.csv` files).
- Cleans timestamps and standardizes columns (`building_name`, `timestamp`, `month`, `kwh`).
- Adds `month` column for monthly aggregations.
- Computes daily and weekly totals using `resample`.
- Building-wise statistics: total, mean, min, max.
- Simple object model (MeterReading, Building, BuildingManager) for building-level analysis.
- Produces a 3-panel dashboard (`dashboard.png`):  
  - daily usage trend  
  - weekly average usage per building  
  - daily peak usage scatter
- Exports a cleaned CSV, a building summary CSV, and a readable `summary.txt` executive report.

## Expected CSV Format 

Each CSV should ideally follow this structure:
```
building_name,timestamp,month,kwh
A_block,2024-01-01 00:00:00,1,32.4
```
If a file is missing building_name, the filename is used.
If time is present instead of timestamp, it is auto-corrected.
If usage appears instead of kwh, it is auto-renamed.

## How to Run  
1. Put all building CSVs into the data/ folder.
2. Ensure output/ folder exists.
3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib
```
4. Run the script:
```bash
python main.py
```
5. After running, check the output/ folder for:
- cleaned_energy_data.csv
- building_summary.csv
- dashboard.png
- summary.txt

## Troubleshooting

- If it says “No valid CSV file found”, make sure files are inside ```data/``` and end with .csv.
- If timestamp parsing fails, ensure the timestamp format is ```YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS```.
- If dashboard looks compressed, open dashboard.png directly
